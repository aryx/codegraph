 * Most of the functions in this file returns an option and so should
 * be used with a let* or let/ when called. Note that I do not
 * suffix those functions with _opt because there is always just
 * one function (not like in the stdlib where we have Hashtb.find and
 * Hashtbl.find_opt and so we need a way to say we want the exn or
 * option variant).
