(* Graph of dependencies for the generic AST.
 *
 * See graph_code.ml (in pfff), AST_generic.ml (in semgrep), and
 * main_codegraph.ml (in codegraph) for more information.
 *
 * On the file location of Graph_code_AST.ml:
 * This file is now in the deep-semgrep repository. That prevents me to use it
 * in other OSS projects like codegraph (especially codegraph_build) or
 * codecheck. But actually, codegraph was designed to work with a generated
 * graph_code.marshall and was designed to be independent of programming
 * languages. Same with codecheck. So this is ok.
 * That prevents me to use it for the _.pyi checker that I want to use 
 * for semgrep. However, we could release pycheck binaries and use that
 * in semgrep (anyway, it's not really used by the semgrep-Python team
 * for now and may never be), so not a big deal there too then.
 *
 * Graph_code_AST.ml leverages Naming_AST.ml and generalizes it
 * to resolve names globally, so it could sense to have them close together.
 * It would be also closer to AST_generic.ml. But we want deep-semgrep
 * to remain proprietary for now, so better move it out of semgrep.
 *
 * Note that even though Graph_code_AST.ml is inside the deep-semgrep
 * repository, its library name is pfff-lang_GENERIC-linking and does
 * not have dependencies to other semgrep (or deep-semgrep) modules, so we
 * could easily extract it from deep-semgrep at some point and move it in
 * codegraph for example.
 *
 * What should we do in Naming_AST vs Graph_code_AST? Should we copy
 * and generalize all the Naming_AST logic in Graph_code_AST? It
 * could be nice to have all the resolving code in one file. However,
 * we want to do some name resolving in semgrep too, and local typing
 * there too, so it is actually better to do all what can be done intra-file
 * in Naming_AST.ml and only do the interfile "linking" in Graph_code_AST.ml.
 * We actually can reuse lots of the work done in Naming_AST.ml like
 * the id_resolved import/use, but also id_type! That way we don't have
 * to handle locals/parameters here. This was handled already before and
 * focus only on the imported/exported entities.
 *
 * related work:
 *  - stackgraph (and scope graph) by github
 *  - LSP server
 *  - Datalog?
 *
 * TODO:
 *  - TODO handle the import foo.bar.* here, which could not be handled
 *    in Naming_AST.ml
 *  - SEMI integrate graph_code_java.ml
 *  - integrate graph_code_cmt.ml
 *  - integrate the other language-specific graph_code_xxx.ml
