(* Types for the typing of AST_generic.expr.
 *
 * Note that right now this module is only used by Graph_code_AST.ml
 * during name resolving as we need to remember the type of entities
 * and expressions to be able to resolve field or method access.
 *
 * Why not simply reuse AST_generic.type_ ? Because here we want to make
 * sure type names are fully resolved.
 * In the futur, we may also want to apply more complex normalizations to
 * simplify type checking or typing/name resolving.
 *
 * Lots of the functions in this module return an option, so you might
 * want to use let* when you call them.
 *
 * alt: reuse, which would remove the need for the converters?
