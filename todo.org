*** update codegraph to OCaml 5.1 AST?

*** move all pfff/todo.txt in codegraph/todo.txt

* Features

** Codegraph

*** filter the equal_xxx, pp_xxx functions, so they don't count as users
of a field, and also they reduce the number of entities in a file
(e.g., expanding AST_generic takes forever because of all those generated code)

** Codegraph_build

* Internals

** GUI 

*** use bogue with sdl2+cairo instead of lablgtk?
still weird display bug on macOS?

*** use model-view-update to simplify the code? rewrite using FRP/ELM style?

*** port to the web? use Dream?


*** experiment with JsOfOCairo??
or use directly Canvas? Worth factorizing code?


* Infra

** Install infra

*** OPAM package, people want to install it
#but depends on semgrep libs and codemap libs so need first to package those
